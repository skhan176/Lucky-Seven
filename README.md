# Lucky-Seven
As long as there is money, play the game. Each round, the program rolls a virtual pair of dice for the user. If the sum of the 2 dice is equal to 7, the player wins $4 otherwise, the player loses $1. Your job is to write a program that plays this game, which will also demonstrate the futility of playing Lucky Sevens. The program asks the user how many dollars they have to bet. If the starting bet is less than or equal to 0, display an error message. When the user clicks the Play button, the program then rolls the dice repeatedly until all the money is gone. Hint: Use a loop construct to keep playing until the money is gone. Hint: We created a rollDice() function in the Rolling Dice exercise. The program keeps track of how many rolls were taken before the money ran out. The program keeps track of the maximum amount of money held by the player. The program keeps track of how many rolls were taken at the point when the user held the most money. Hint: For steps 4, 5, and 6, declare some variables
